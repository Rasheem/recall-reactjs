# Recall
## Written with ReactJS

Test your memory!

## Configuration

  - size (5): the size of the matrix
  - numToChoose (9): number of tiles to remember


## Other Versions
  - [Vanilla JS](https://github.com/mruzekw/recall)

Note: Must serve from HTTP server since the JSX tranformer manually loads `script.js` via an AJAX request. Easiest solution: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the project directory.
